# House Price Prediction

## Executive Summary

This project involves predicting house prices using a linear regression model based on various features of houses in Boston. By analyzing data on crime rates, property taxes, and other factors, we aim to develop a model that accurately estimates house prices. The goal is to provide a tool for real estate professionals and potential buyers to make informed decisions based on predictive analytics.

## Problem

Predicting house prices is essential for various stakeholders in the real estate market, including investors, buyers, and sellers. Accurate price predictions enable better decision-making regarding property investments and pricing strategies. This project addresses the challenge of predicting house prices based on multiple features, with the aim of creating a reliable and efficient predictive model.

## Methodology

1. **Data Import and Exploration**
   - Import the dataset from a CSV file.
   - Explore the dataset to understand its structure, including features and target variables.
   - Perform initial data cleaning and handle missing values.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Conduct exploratory analysis to understand data distributions and relationships between features.
   - Use visualizations such as correlation heatmaps and box plots to uncover patterns and insights.

3. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handle missing values using appropriate imputation techniques.
   - Prepare data for modeling by splitting it into training and testing sets.

4. **Model Building**
   - Train a linear regression model using the training dataset.
   - Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as R-squared, Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

5. **Model Evaluation**
   - Compare predicted prices with actual values to assess the accuracy of the model.
   - Visualize the results using scatter plots to demonstrate the modelâ€™s performance.

## Skills

- **Data Analysis**: Proficiency in analyzing and visualizing data using tools such as pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
- **Statistical Modeling**: Experience with linear regression and performance evaluation metrics.
- **Machine Learning**: Knowledge of model training, testing, and evaluation.
- **Programming**: Strong skills in Python for data manipulation and modeling.
